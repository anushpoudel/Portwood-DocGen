# CLAUDE.md — SalesforceDocGen

## Triage

See `TRIAGE.md` at the repo root for the priority rubric (P0/P1/P2/P3 + severity labels + milestone scheme). Apply it when classifying new issues or proposing what to work on next. Current milestones live on GitHub: `v1.89.0` (in flight — Template_Version Type picklist fix + CSS 2.1 guidance + #60/#72), `v1.90.0`, `Backlog`.

## Mission

Maintain Portwood DocGen — a native Salesforce 2GP package for generating Word and PDF documents from any Salesforce record. Work is roadmap-driven via the GitHub issue board; treat it as the source of truth for what's in flight.

When picking up work, prefer the highest open priority on the smallest milestone. P0 silent-corruption bugs jump the queue. Community-contributed fixes (the `community-contribution` label) are usually fast wins because the reporter has already done the diagnostic work.

## Critical: three merge-tag resolution paths

`DocGenGiantQueryAssembler` does **not** call `processXml()`. A fix to section-tag logic in `processXml` only covers row-level loop bodies. Parent-level tags outside the loop are resolved by `DocGenGiantQueryAssembler.resolveParentMergeTags()`, and grand-total aggregates by `resolveGiantAggregateTags()`. If a parser-level change needs to behave consistently for templates that fall into the giant-query path (>2000 child rows), the logic has to be mirrored in the assembler or routed through `processXmlForTest` the same way format-suffix tags already are. Always check whether your fix needs the same change in the giant-query parent path and add an e2e-07 assertion either way.

## Critical: zero-heap PDF image rendering (don't accidentally regress)

For PDF output, `{%ImageField}` tags with ContentVersion IDs skip blob loading. `currentOutputFormat` is set to `'PDF'` before `processXml()` calls; in `buildImageXml()`, when `currentOutputFormat == 'PDF'` and value is `068xxx`, query only `Id, FileExtension` (NOT `VersionData`) and store the relative URL `/sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/<cvId>`. Image URLs in HTML for `Blob.toPdf()` MUST be relative — absolute URLs and data URIs render broken.

If your fix touches `processXml`, do not add `VersionData` to the PDF-path SOQL and do not prepend `URL.getOrgDomainUrl()` anywhere in the image pipeline.

## Critical: Experience Cloud guest path (PR #70, v1.86+)

Guest PDF rendering routes through `DocGen_Guest_Render__e` platform event → `DocGenGuestRenderQueueable` so the actual render runs as Automated Process (not the guest user). This is required because `Blob.toPdf` fetches `<img src=...>` over HTTP, and guest users can't reach the lightning subdomain. Don't unwind this routing.

DOCX assembly for guests still runs inline as the guest user — the same architectural fix has not been mirrored to DOCX yet (issue #72). Until that's done, guest DOCX with rich-text-pasted images will silently omit images whose `ContentDocumentLink.Visibility = InternalUsers`.

For LWR guest downloads, `/sfc/servlet.shepherd/...` URLs MUST be prefixed with `@salesforce/community/basePath` — bare-org-host paths return a 90-byte JSON redirect (v1.87.0 fix).

## Package info

- Package: Portwood DocGen, Unlocked 2GP, namespace `portwoodglobal`
- Current shipped version: **v1.88.0** (`04tVx000000Qu09IAC`)
- DevHub: `Portwood Global - Production` (dave@portwoodglobalsolutions.com)
- Staging org for release validation: `portwood-staging` — must be created with `--no-namespace` so source-deploy lands in the default namespace and the e2e scripts' bare class/field references compile. Assign `DocGen_Admin` permset to the running user immediately after deploy or field-level security blocks the e2e scripts.
- Dev scratch: `docgen-designer`

## Release validation checklist

All three checks MUST pass before release. No exceptions.

### 1. E2E test suite

```bash
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-01-permissions.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-02-template-crud.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-03-generate-pdf.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-04-generate-docx.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-05-generate-bulk.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-06-signatures.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-07-syntax1.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-07-syntax2.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-07-syntax3.apex
sf apex run --target-org <org> -f scripts/e2e-08-cleanup.apex
```

Each script must print `PASS: N  FAIL: 0  ALL TESTS PASSED`. Sequence: 01 standalone, 02 creates test data, 03–06 depend on 02, 07-syntax1/2/3 standalone (use `processXmlForTest`), 08 cleans up.

When fixing a parser-level bug, add a regression assertion in `e2e-07-syntax1` or `e2e-07-syntax2` that exercises the offending pattern via `processXmlForTest`. Each script must stay under 18,000 chars (Anonymous Apex limit is 20,000).

### 2. Apex test suite

```bash
sf apex run test --target-org <org> --test-level RunLocalTests --wait 15 --code-coverage
```

Expected: `Outcome: Passed`, `Pass Rate: 100%`, org-wide coverage ≥ 75%.

### 3. Code Analyzer

```bash
sf code-analyzer run --workspace "force-app/" --rule-selector "Security" --rule-selector "AppExchange" --view table
```

Expected: `0 High severity violation(s) found`. ~30 Moderate false positives are acceptable (see `code-analyzer.yml`).

## Pre-commit: prettier (CI gate)

CI runs `npm run format:check` (prettier) on every PR; a failure blocks merge. Run before pushing:

```bash
npm install   # one-time, adds prettier to node_modules/.bin
npm run format        # auto-fix
npm run format:check  # verify clean
```

Covers `force-app/**/*.{cls,trigger,page,component,cmp,html,js,xml}`, `scripts/**/*.apex`, and root `*.{json,md,yml,yaml}`. Apex scripts under `/scripts/` are formatted too — long string concatenations get reflowed, so don't fight the wrap.

## Subsystem caution

Several subsystems are tightly coupled and easy to break with surgical fixes — reach for `git log -- CLAUDE.md` and `git show 6a2deff^:CLAUDE.md` to recover the deeper historical notes if you're touching:

- **Signatures (especially v3 packets / multi-template)** — three hand-rolled loops, no content-correctness tests, two divergent creation paths. Read the `project_signature_v3_fragility.md` memory before changing anything here.
- **Client-side DOCX assembly** (`docGenZipWriter.js`) — splits work between server (XML merge) and browser (ZIP repack). The boundary is load-bearing; don't move work across it without checking guest/Experience Cloud paths.
- **HTML templates and `Blob.toPdf` rendering** — Flying Saucer is essentially **CSS 2.1** plus a small CSS 3 subset. `display: flex`/`grid`, `gap`, `linear-gradient(...)`, `calc(...)`, CSS variables, and most CSS 3 layout features are silently ignored — the page renders but layout collapses to default block flow. When troubleshooting "the PDF looks wrong," first check whether the source HTML uses any of these and rewrite to `<table>`-based layout + solid colors. Also: when both the engine `<style>` (built from `Page_Size__c`/`Page_Orientation__c`/`Custom_Margins__c` template fields) and the source HTML's own `<style>` declare `@page`, you get a conflict — recommend authors clear the template page fields when their source CSS already specifies `@page`. Issues #60 and #71 both live here.
- **Query Config formats** (V1 flat string, V3 node tree) — V3's `processChildNodes` and V1's `stitchGrandchildren` reproduce similar patterns; bug fixes often need to land in both (see #67).
- **Watermarks, font handling, command hub** — light traffic, but the test coverage is sparse, so verify visually after edits.
